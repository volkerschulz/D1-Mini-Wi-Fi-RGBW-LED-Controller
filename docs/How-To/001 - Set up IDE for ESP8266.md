# Set up your Arduino IDE for ESP8266 boards

If you've never before used your Arduino IDE to flash a D1 Mini (or any other ESP8266 board), you will need to install board definitions, libraries and tools by following these steps:

1. Start your Arduino IDE.
2. Go to "File / Preferences" or press "Ctrl+Comma".
3. For "Additional Boards Manager URLs" add the following URL: http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json and hit "OK".
4. Go to "Tools / Board: / Boards Manager".
5. Find "esp8266 by ESP8266 Community", click the item, then click "Install" and wait for the installation to finish.
6. Hit "Close" to close the Boards Manager.
7. Restart your IDE.

That's it. Next you want to [Get your D1 Mini up and running](./002%20-%20Get%20your%20D1%20Mini%20up%20and%20running.md).
